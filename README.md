# GoReleaser Pro Prebuilt Example

This repo contains a quick and to-the-point example of how to use
[GoReleaser Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro)
[split and merge builds](https://goreleaser.com/customization/partial/).

This also serves as a [nightly](https://goreleaser.com/customization/nightlies/) example.

---

For now, this repo is not using the goreleaser action, as it does not work with nightlies (yet), but it will, soon enough.
